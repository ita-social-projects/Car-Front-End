# Changelog

## [4.2.1] - 2020-07-21

### Fixed

- Add mock for `interceptors.eject` by @webbushka

### Changed

- Ignore case when matching HTTP methods by @Chris-Thompson-bnsf

## [4.2.0] - 2020-06-04

### Breaking

- `throwIfRequested` in `CancelToken` now actually throws if requested (not surprising, so not "really" breaking)

### Added

- Added `getReqByMatchUrl` (!52) by @niltonvasques
- Expose pending requests as `queue` (!52) by @niltonvasques

### Fixed

- Fixed some bugs regarding to the cancel implementation

## [4.1.0] - 2020-05-22

### Added

- Support `axios(url, [config])` syntax

## [4.0.0] - 2020-04-28

### Changed

- Using `.cancel` in the code to test now actually cancels (i.e. rejects) the axios call / promise.

### Removed

- The signatures of `get`, `delete`, `head`, and `options` now align with these of axios, meaning that the third argument (used to be `data`) has been removed.

## [3.2.0] - 2019-12-08

### Added

- Added `mockResponseFor` and `getReqMatching` to support more sophisticated request-responding (#43 by @ThiefMaster)

### Other

- Updated dependencies

## [3.1.2] - 2019-10-26

### Other

- Update dependencies

## [3.1.1] - 2019-09-07

### Fixed

- Fixes an upstream bug in `synchronous-promise` where `finally` would be called too early (#38)

## [3.1.0] - 2019-07-29

### Changed

- We switched the library for synchronous promises from `jest-mock-promise` to `synchronous-promise`. This offers us:
  - Support for `finally` (#35)
  - Better handling of `.catch` (#17)

- The error object used for `mockError` is now passed directly to `catch` / `reject` instead of being cloned beforehand (#14) (Breaking)


### Removed

- You can no longer pass the return value of `then` and `catch` to `lastPromiseGet`. This was an undocumented feature. Use the promise directly instead.

## [3.0.0] - 2019-04-27

### Added

* Allow specifying requests to respond to (#1) - see README
* Provide mocked cancellation (#30, #32), thanks @VanTanev 

### Changed

* Make interface methods non-optional in typings


## [2.4.0] - 2019-04-08

### Added

-  Add support for setting default common headers (#16)

### Changed

- Throw more descriptive error messages when trying to respond to no request as described in #3  (throwing an error can be disabled totally by passing a new, third argument `silentMode` to `mockResponse` and `mockError`)
- Improve type definitions (#25)

### Docs

- Improved docs (#26)

## [2.3.0] - 2019-03-19

### Added
